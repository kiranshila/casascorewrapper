// Tables can store data in a variety of places:
//
// * columns and rows
// * keywords associated with the table
// * keywords associated with a column
//
// All columns must have the same number of rows but they may either store
// scalars or arrays in each row. We need functions to read and write to both
// types of columns as well as writing to one cell (a single row of a single
// column) at a time.
//
// Similarly we must support reading and writing to keywords associated with the
// table and with each of the individual columns. We may store either scalars or
// arrays as keywords.
//
// Finally we must support a host of data types: bool, int, float, double,
// complex<float>, and strings among others. C does not support function
// overloading so we will need a separate method for each of these data types.
// Strings are special little snow flakes and will require some extra attention.
//
// As you can see a huge number of methods are required. We will make liberal
// use of C++ templating to make each of these method definitions as simple as
// possible. On the Julia side we will need to make use of meta-programming and
// multiple-dispatch to ease the pain of defining all the corresponding
// functions and then selecting which one to call.
//
// Note that I tried to keep this file as organized as possible, but there are
// simply so many definitions that it has inevitably become scattered.
// Apologies!

// Now define methods for interacting with casacore::Table. Again strings will
// usually need to be special cased.

// All the functions defined within `extern "C" { ... }` may be called directly
// from Julia.
